- [Mos] Murail: sculptor, who reveals forms concealed in spectrum, with:
  - active filtering
  - selection of tempered pitches
  - spectral areas
  - spectral exploration
  - 1. to think of the continuum before thinking of the discrete.
  - 2. to have a global approach and not a cellular or a sequential one.
  - 3. to use logarithmic/expositional methods of organization instead of linear ones.
  - 4. to build in a functional way.
  - 5. to be concerned with the relation between conception and perception.
 - [Mos] Dufourt precepts:
  - 1. The piece is conceived as a synthetic whole;
  - 2. There is a basic congruence between the whole and its inner division;
  - 3. The manner in which the piece is organized coincides with the manner in which it evolves through time;
  - 4. Spectral music is founded on a theory of functional fields and on an aesthetics of unstable forms;
  - 5. This music marks a progress towards immanence and transparence;
  - 6. The renewal of the traditional instrumental practice, that of string and wind instruments.
 - [Mos] Dufourt about "Erewhon": "what counts in the percussion is not the impact, it is the resonance's dynamic spectrum."
 - [Mos] Grisey: Sound parameters determine the fluctuating and ambiguous character of the [sound] fields, as in the case of the work on the contrast 'luminosity/shade' of each sound or group of sounds. It is the distribution of the harmonics, the relative intensity of the partials, the combination sounds, and the different fluctuations, that give to each sound or group of sounds a specific aura, and by selecting one of the potential components and bringing it out, it will then become a new radiant object. Out of this sound we can again choose and update this or that component, and so forth.
 - [Duf] Dufourt:
  - Debussy - sonic substance
  - Varèse - global dynamism of sonority
  - Xenakis - idea of tree structures, graphic representation of hierarchies
  - Ligeti - ramification
  - Stockhausen - sonic continuum
  - appropriation of inharmonicity
  - differentiation of noise
  - Alteration/distortion of harmonic profiles of waves
  - Modulation
  - Threshold, is found between stabilization and conditions that forbid it
  - systems of transition, comings and goings, fluctuations between:
 ▪ harmony and timbre
 ▪ complex sounds and noise
 ▪ pitch and noise
 ▪ harmonicity and inharmonicity
 ▪ timbre and saturation
  - spectral music - art based on the principle of functional interaction
  - music of adjoining categories, hybrid objects
  - its problematic - crossing thresholds of perception
  - its working hypothesis - interference or intermodulation
  - spectral music as cybernetics:
 ▪ interaction between unstable elements
 ▪ criteria, that determine location between reference points and thresholds
 ▪ and a comparator, a device comparing voltages or streams of data - or a feedback circuit
