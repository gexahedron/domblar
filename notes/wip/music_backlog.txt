- создаю (functional) chord progression chart
  хочу немного эту идею разработать
  в духе
    - Sky Macklay - Many, Many Cadences
  + хочется микротональное расширение

  - как это закодить?
    - раз это tonal harmony, то подразумевается scale
      major или minor
      (minor - это 9 нот на самом деле)


V-I:
  root motion
  4->0 or 4->7


kind of done:
- V/V - V - I
- add Kostka-Payne chart


- DONE: fix chord collapse
  начну с этого
  был chord1
  стал chord2
  оба в edo, не в scale
  хочу получить весь pc_set для chord2
   правда если надо увеличить число нот - то надо добавлять новую логику про split voice-leading
  какие ещё возможны проблемы
    - в теории первый аккорд может быть очень компактным
      хотя в данный момент вероятность такого события кажется нулевая
    - ноты с одинаковыми pc классами в первом аккорде могут вести в разные pc классы во втором аккорде, но возможно мы этого не хотим
      а возможно наоборот, очень даже и хотим, типа не допускать parallel octaves

в Dexed выбор программы - это выбор пресета!

игра в ограничения, 23edo
- есть grid, rhythms, melodies (repetitions, variations), harmonies
- grid зафиксирован, 16 битов, 4x4
- grid видимо ещё как-то влияет на возможные совместимые rhythms
- melodies допустим живут внутри scales, не имеют больших прыжков, и могут переходить иногда из одной scale в другую по определённым критериям (плавно); ещё желательно как-то учитывать память и повторения или вариации
- harmonies тоже завязаны на grid, про одновременное звучание нескольких melodies

vq-wav2vec: Self-Supervised Learning of Discrete Speech Representations
https://openreview.net/forum?id=rylwJxrYDS




Yeah I just made a comment above that explains the pipeline a bit more. Also here's some relevant code fragments:
https://gist.github.com/efirdc/3a30a0d7df9891c97d8d182a4772eb00

I'm capturing my system audio waveform using a custom build of this PyAudio library which allows for that: https://github.com/intxcc/pyaudio_portaudio

I convert the waveform to a frequency spectrum using a Fast Fourier Transform with numpy. I map the frequency spectrum to the latent Z space vector using a matrix multiplication with a random normal matrix i.e. np.randn((num_latent_z, num_freq_bins)). I do a bit of additional smoothing on that matrix so that adjacent frequency bins move to similar areas in the latent space.

So then I have some fixed centroid z face, and the music z vector is added to that to get the final z_target. The actual latent position is continuously interpolated towards that z_target using a spring equation:
z_vel += (z_target - z) * stiffness - z_vel * damping
z += z_vel
Where stiffness and damping are parameters you can choose. I really like using springs for interpolation, especially when the target is changing dynamically. Idea comes from the react-motion animation library. They have a demo here: http://chenglou.github.io/react-motion/demos/demo5-spring-parameters-chooser/

Throughout the video I randomly change the centroid to new positions. You can see that happening when all the blue sliders move. The matrix which maps the frequency spectrum to z offsets is also randomized whenever I change the centroid. That way the music is always exploring some different latent dimensions. I also try to keep the music offset fairly small so that its mostly just exploring the neighbor faces from the centroid and not jumping around the latent space wildly.

A lot of foley sounds are (unintentionally) ironic, especially when you consider them in the context of acoustic ecology. This is probably the most famous example, but stuff like using torn paper to imitate fire cracking etc. is also quite amusing.

    Jon Appleton,
    Richard Boulanger (Solemn Song for Evening (1990)),
    Georg Hajdu,
    Juan Reyes' ppP (1999-2000),
    Ami Radunskaya's "A Wild and Reckless Place" (1990),
    Charles Carpenter (Frog à la Pêche (1994) & Splat),
    Elaine Walker (Stick Men (1991), Love Song, and Greater Good (2011))
- justly-tuned Bohlen–Pierce scale
- lambda scale
- 833 cents scale
- Other non-octave tunings investigated by Bohlen[18] include twelve steps in the tritave, named A12 by Enrique Moreno [19] and based on the 4:7:10 chord About this soundPlay (help·info), seven steps in the octave (7-tet) or similar 11 steps in the tritave, and eight steps in the octave, based on 5:7:9 About this soundPlay (help·info) and of which only the just version would be used. Additionally, the pentave can be divided into eight steps which approximates chords of the form 5:9:13:17:21:25.[20] The Bohlen 833 cents scale is based on the Fibonacci sequence, although it was created from combination tones, and contains a complex network of harmonic relations due to the inclusion of coinciding harmonics of stacked 833 cent intervals. For example, "step 10 turns out to be identical with the octave (1200 cents) to the base tone, at the same time featuring the Golden Ratio to step 3".[21]
  Alternate scales may be specified by indicating the size of equal tempered steps, for example Wendy Carlos' 78-cent alpha scale and 63.8-cent beta scale, and Gary Morrison's 88-cent scale (13.64 steps per octave or 14 per 1232-cent stretched octave).[22] This gives the alpha scale 15.39 steps per octave and the beta scale 18.75 steps per octave.[23]
- Paul Erlich proposed dividing each step of the Bohlen–Pierce into thirds so that the tritave is divided into 39 equal steps instead of 13 equal steps. The scale, which can be viewed as three evenly staggered Bohlen-Pierce scales, gives additional odd harmonics. The 13-step scale hits the odd harmonics 3:1; 5:3, 7:3; 7:5, 9:5; 9:7, and 15:7; while the 39-step scale includes all of those and many more (11:5, 13:5; 11:7, 13:7; 11:9, 13:9; 13:11, 15:11, 21:11, 25:11, 27:11; 15:13, 21:13, 25:13, 27:13, 33:13, and 35:13), while still missing almost all of the even harmonics (including 2:1; 3:2, 5:2; 4:3, 8:3; 6:5, 8:5; 9:8, 11:8, 13:8, and 15:8). The size of this scale is about 25 equal steps to a ratio slightly larger than an octave, so each of the 39 equal steps is slightly smaller than half of one of the 12 equal steps of the standard scale.[24]

I'm looking for some resources on musical traditions that use polyrhythms. Ewe drumming, mbira, kora, gamelan. I can find plenty of examples of these, but I would like a little bit of theory to understand what's going on. Thanks in advance!
Peter Magadini - Polyrhythms: the musician’s guide
What I’ll highly recommend though is Kofi Agawu’s “representing African music” that focuses on common misconceptions or wrong essentialisms about African music and alternative perspectives to them, including two whole chapters about the ideology behind our imaginations of polyrhythm as “African rhythm”.

2. I like, and in fact compose according to, the harmonic implications of fractions and ratios. I like knowing, when I use a 21/16 interval, that the upper pitch is an implied seventh harmonic of the dominant of the lower pitch. I like the way a 7/6 minor third not only has a different flavor than a 6/5, but also a different implied set of related pitches, so that it suggests ways to harmonize it. I like the way the numbers keep every pitch related to every other one in the system via a series of implied, interconnected harmonic series'. The higher the numbers, the more exotic the pitch seems. That's an interesting thing to work with compositionally. No matter how dissonant and atonal you get, the gravitational pull of 1/1 keeps you oriented to a fixed point in the universe.

7. Not least, I am building on the work of six composers whose music I deeply love: Harry Partch, Ben Johnston, Terry Riley, James Tenney, Lou Harrison, and La Monte Young. All of them use(d) just intonation (although Lou and Jim are variable, sometimes using equal or historical temperaments). I don't know of any other microtonalists working in any other kinds of scales whose music I love nearly so much. I'm fond of the 19-tone, 24-tone, 34-tone, 36-tone, and 72-tone musics of Ivan Wyschnegradsky, Julian Carrillo, Alois Haba, Ezra Sims, Neil Haverstick, and others, but while I get a kick from the pitch relationships, I don't have as deep an affection for the music itself - I thrill to its frisson of weirdness, but don't find it as moving as Johnston's Fourth String Quartet, or Partch's Barstow, or Young's The Well-Tuned Piano. I harbor no theory as to why all my favorite microtonal music seems to be in just intonation - possibly just a coincidence. But I wouldn't start working in 72-tone or any other equal temperament unless I first heard some music in that scale that blew me away, in emotional as well as technical terms.

Now&Xen Podcast: 2.3.5.7.11.13 JI Kyle Gann

I love the two-piano medium. Some of my favorite works are written for it: Busoni's Fantasia Contrappuntistica, Satie's Trois Morceau en form de poire, Ives's quarter-tone pieces, Stockhausen's Mantra, Ligeti's Monument / Selbst-Portrait / Bewegung, Zimmermann's Monologe, Bartok's and Jonathan Kramer's two-piano Sonatas with percussion, Kevin Volans's Cicada, Reigger's Variations. My first work for two pianists was an ambitious, difficult, irascible early work: I'itoi Variations (1985). I always wanted to write another, better, less virtuosic one that reflected my more mature aesthetic. In summer of 2006 I had the time, and wrote Implausible Sketches. I decided to make it playable for two pianists at one keyboard, to facilitate performance - and the pieces all have the faculty of playing the low and high registers off of each other.




========================

La Monte Young's
The Well-Tuned Piano
https://www.kylegann.com/wtp.html

The premise of this tuning is actually very simple, and analogous to the tuning from which European classical tuning evolved. Young's tuning can be arranged in a grid in which the perfect fifths (3/2 ratios) run in one direction (here: left to right), and the pure minor sevenths (7/4 ratios) in another (bottom to top):

49/32 147/128 441/256 1323/1024
7/4   21/16   63/32   189/128    567/512
1/1   3/2     9/8



https://www.facebook.com/groups/xenharmonic2/permalink/3026641350689480/
https://soundcloud.com/moonwheel/250219-819-scale-test/s-aBzT1
tuning based on 3-9-7-13 (holmberg-larsen):
1:1
273:256
9:8
39:32
21:16
91:64
3:2
819:512
13:8
7:4
117:64
63:32




получается что для (анти-)шумового синта можно вот такое попробовать:

49/32 147/128 441/256 1323/1024
7/4   21/16   63/32   189/128
1/1   3/2     9/8     27/16

хотя зная что у янга ноты довольно близки друг к другу - надо другие интервалы попробовать

или базовое

  A     E     B     F#
 5/6   5/4  15/8  45/16
  F     C     G     D
 2/3   1/1   3/2   9/4
  Db    Ab    Eb    Bb
 8/15  4/5   6/5   9/5
includes Ptolemaic

или может какой just intonated noise сделать?


вопрос
- почему работают эти названия нот?
  A,B,C,D,E,F,G
  работают - видимо в том плане, что интервалов тоже только 7 рассматривается
  но всё равно не до конца ясно
  почему не происходит enharmonicity в just intonation?

  кажется до меня дошло - это из 3-limit вылезает
  вот эта смена названий, по 7 букв подряд
  а если дальше хотим - то докидываются наверно b или #,
  типа учёт коммы, и вроде всё работает

The schismatic temperament (which is closely related to the syntonic, and which has arguably been used in traditional Turkish music), and
The Magic temperament, which is included as a control, as it is more-distantly related to the syntonic and has never been used for music-making outside of the microtonal music community.

For example, Joseph Pehrson has composed in the “Miracle” system (see http://www.soundclick.com/pro/?BandID=104245), Herman Miller in the “Porcupine,” “Lemba,” and other systems (see http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/), and Gene Ward Smith in many systems (http://www.xenharmony.org). Though the overwhelming majority of my own public musical output so far has been on standard-tuned instruments, I have procured several microtonal instruments, played them on my own and with the free-improv group MAD DUXX in performances and recordings, and performed sets of alternatively-tuned compositions at two American Festival of Microtonal Music concerts – the first of which was reviewed in Gann, Kyle, June 8, 1999. “Micro Breweries”, The Village Voice


Though we had worked out many of its details before his appearance in the community, special thanks goes to Gene Ward Smith for applying modern mathematics (namely, the field of Grassmann, or exterior, or multilinear, algebra) to this subject, placing it on a firmer foundation and allowing for many problems to be solved and new results to be obtained.

comma pump
A canonical example is the chord progression ||: Cmaj | Am | Dm | G7 :|| in meantone temperament, which would deposit you the tiny interval of 81/80 lower from the root if it were performed in just intonation. This chord progression sounds perfectly natural to most western listeners, as it is very common in western music. One way to think of it is that it takes advantage of the relationship that V/V/V/V/V = III, or alternatively that V/V = IV/vi.

Analogous chord progressions exist in other temperaments: for example, in Porcupine temperament, the minor thirds are tuned slightly sharp and the minor sevenths slightly flat, so that the relationship bIII/bIII/bIII = IV/IV holds true. In Mavila temperament, displayed on this page under the "Mavila Experiments," the fifths are flat, so that V/V/V/V/V = bIII and IV/IV/IV = III. In Blackwood temperament, the fifths are so sharp that five of them closes at the octave, so that V/V/V/V/V = I; other intervals such as the major third need to be placed "outside" of the circle of fifths in this temperament.


Less trivially, many of (for example) Art Tatum's long substitute chord progressions that magically go off into harmonic space and somehow land on the I chord can be analyzed as comma pumps that temper various commas in 12-EDO (such as 81/80, 128/125, 648/625, 2048/2025, and so on). So it would be great to play jazz in 19-EDO, for instance, where you have an entirely new set of extremely hip long substitute chord progressions to draw from.


Shadow Comma
Then, for any such comma, there is basically a "shadow" comma that, if you temper it instead of the original, gives you a scale in which 4:5:6 chords are replaced with 10:12:15. Every piece of music already automatically "exists" in this inverted shadow temperament, and all of the comma pumps automatically translate perfectly, except 6/5 becomes 5/4, major becomes minor, and vice versa. It's like negative harmony on steroids. If you do this with the 81/80 meantone temperament, you get the 138/125 "Mavila" temperament.

> Is there a way, or a possibility, that you can derive the "Shadow Comma" for a given temperament? Or is it generally a case-by-case basis with more room for interpretation?
> It's a matrix multiplication that switches 5/4 and 6/5 - I will post in a minute, on mobile now
> so if you write your monzo as a column vector, you left-multiply with this matrix, which I'll call M:
[1 0 3]
[0 1 1]
[0 0 -1]
This sends 2/1 to 2/1, 3/1 to 3/1, and 5/1 to 24/5. So if you right-multiply that with the monzo for 81/80, which is |-4 4 -1> (as a column vector), you get |-7 3 1> or 135/128, which is mavila. If you do this with the monzo for 250/243 (porcupine) you get 1024/1125, which is the mavilaized version of porcupine called "enipucrop"

> Interestingly is that the shadow version of 32805/32768 (schismatic) is 20480/19683 (5-limit "superpyth", though I hate that name for it)
> Tuning theory basically is just linear algebra on the space of JI vectors. The only part of linear algebra that doesn't feature prominently in tuning theory is the eigendecomposition. Quotient spaces are temperaments, the null space is the temperament kernel, the dual space of covectors is vals and tuning maps, etc
> Petr Pařízek Wouldn't it help for someone who's not familiar with 5-limit 2D temperaments if he/she had some software which would allow to map an arbitrary scale onto a conventional keyboard and play it via an external MIDI keyboard or something like that? Personally, I think I began to slowly understand how they worked when I first tried to find an exact mathematical algorithm for tempering out a given interval. I'll tell you what the key was. Instead of expressing it as 3 exponents of the lowest 3 prime numbers, I needed to express them as 2 exponents of some (often non-integer) factors. And once I got that going, I felt like on a journey to Wonderland because I kept discovering one 2D temperament after another. And you know what this procedure turned out to be excellent for? For finding chord progressions and chord patterns characteristic for the specific temperament. I'll never forget those days. It was the greatest discovery in the microtonal field that I had ever experienced.
> Mike Battaglia Petr Pařízek it certainly made use of things like Amity temperament...
> Steve Martin Mike, yes i noticed that relationship between schismatic and superpyth, like Wilson's "enantiodromia" between meantone and mavila.
> Kite Giedraitis Shadow comma, huh, that's a new term to me. But I think "mirror comma" might be a better name. Because it's a reciprocal relationship, right? Isn't 135/128's shadow 81/80? It seems more natural for a mirror image of a mirror image to be the original, than for the shadow of a shadow to be the original.
The linear algebra method works to find this comma, but it's not the only way. You can do it visually if you understand the lattice. For a 2-D octave-equivalent lattice that's triangularized, just draw the comma vector, then find it's mirror image reflected on the 3-limit chain of 5ths. If it's < 0¢, invert it, which means rotating the vector 180 degrees. If inverted, this is the same as reflecting the original vector along a line perpendicular to the 3-limit axis, going through 1/1. I personally think this is a much more elegant method than multiplying by a matrix. Because you can do it in your head. Altho the matrix method works better if you're writing computer code to find the comma.

One strategy I’ve used was to play around on JI keyboard layouts of my own, to hear if there were any “almost-JI” chords that cropped up. That’s how I found the incredible industriousness of the marvel comma (225/224) after playing in 7-limit JI.


If the tuning is not consistent within a given limit -- that is, if for some odd numbers a, b, and c less than or equal to the limit, the best approximation of b:a plus the best approximation of c:b does not equal the best approximation of c:a -- then no accuracy value is computed. Consistency beyond the 15-limit is not achieved with fewer than 58 equal steps per octave.



> As you can see at the bottom of the "edomap" table on my webpage, in the 5-limit, 31edo tempers out the syntonic, ampersand, and würschmidt commas, and the semicomma (and others farther out on the lattice) ... but _not_ the schisma, diesis, kleisma, pythagorean-comma, and many more.
http://tonalsoft.com/enc/number/31edo.aspx
> It's fun because I have been playing a lot recently with 53edo and 118edo both of which temper the schisma but not the syntonic comma.


Cam Taylor Pretty much everything you see on this page, the Xenharmonic Alliance, the Just Intonation Network, and a few other pages. I would recommend Sevish for electronic stuff, Brendan Byrnes for pop, traditional world musics from most countries for doing their thing, Phillip Gerschlauer for jazz, Zhea Erose for cool futuristic jazz-tinged pop fusion, Eric Ederer for cool Turkish fusion, Ron Sword for micro metal, Juhani Nuorvala for beautiful minimalist and modern art pieces. Also plenty of goodies from Casey Hale, Johnny Reinhard, Dolores Caterino, myself, I mean there's really too much good stuff to summarise in one little post like this. Good luck exploring. Sevish and Mike Battaglia both had good microtonal playlists on Spotify last I checked.


Cody HallenbeckSome personal favorites: Lou Harrison's guitar works, performed by John Schneider. Easley Blackwood's microtonal etudes are a classic for exploring small equal temperaments. Toby Twinning's choral works. Sevish's EDM stuff. Bill Alves/HMC American Gamelan JI gamelan works. I could go on but those are some of the higher profile works that I personally really like. https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1OcPPq0ohnUarvDCERaxaR... if you have Spotify has quite a lot to check out--I like setting it to shuffle until something strikes my ear, then I check the album out.

Lou Harrison Piano Concerto, just the piano part though. I believe he wanted to have the different instrument families of the orchestra play in different tunings.
  Juhani Nuorvala Not really; the piano is tuned in Kirnberger 2, a baroque temperament with a just interval between most pitches, and Harrison left out those instruments in the orchestra that can't play in such a tuning. Everyone is supposed to be in the same tuning; the realities of actual performances will vary.

New musical effects[edit source]
Dynamic Tonality enables two new kinds of real-time musical effects: those that require a change in tuning, and those that affect the distribution of energy among a pseudo-Harmonic timbre's partials.

Tuning-based effects[edit source]
Dynamic Tonality's novel tuning-based effects[2] include:

Polyphonic tuning bends, in which the pitch of the tonic remains fixed while the pitches of all other notes change to reflect changes in the tuning, with notes that are close to the tonic in tonal space changing pitch only slightly and those that are distant changing considerably;
New chord progressions that start in a first tuning, change to second tuning (to progress across a comma which the second tuning tempers out but the first tuning does not), optionally change to subsequent tunings for similar reasons, and then conclude in the first tuning; and
Temperament modulations, which start in a first tuning of a first temperament, change to a second tuning of the first temperament which is also a first tuning of a second temperament (a "pivot tuning"), change note-selection among enharmonics to reflect the second temperament, change to a second tuning of the second temperament, then optionally change to additional tunings and temperaments before returning through the pivot tuning to the first tuning of the first temperament.
Timbre-based effects[edit source]
Dynamic Tonality's novel timbre effects[3]:39-40 include:

Primeness: Partials 2, 4, 8, 16, …, 2n are factorised only by prime 2, and so these partials can be said to embody twoness. Partials 3, 9, 27, …, 3n are factorised only by prime 3, and so can be said to embody threeness. Partials 5, 25, 125, …, 5n are factorised only by prime 5, and so can be said to embody fiveness. Other partials are factorised by two, or more, different primes. Partials 12 is factorised by both 2 and 3, and so embodies both twoness and threeness; partial 15 is factorised by 3 and 5, and so embodies both threeness and fiveness. Primeness empowers the musician to manipulate any given timbre such that its twoness, threeness, fiveness, …, primeness can be enhanced or reduced. Adding a second comma to the syntonic temperament's comma sequence defines the 7th partial (see Video 5), thus similarly enabling sevenness.
Conicality: Turning down twoness will lead to an odd-partial-only timbre – a “hollow or nasal” sound[14] reminiscent of cylindrical closed bore instruments (e.g. clarinet). As the twoness is turned up, the even partials are gradually introduced creating a sound more reminiscent of open cylindrical bore instruments (e.g. flute, shakuhachi), or conical bore instruments (e.g. bassoon, oboe, saxophone). This perceptual feature is called conicality.
Richness: When richness is at minimum, only the fundamental sounds; as it is increased, the twoness gain is increased, then the threeness gain, then the fiveness gain, etc..


Blue notes[edit source]
The 7th harmonic is cited by some[15][16] as being the essence of the "blue notes" played in the blues and related music.

Adding the starling comma to the syntonic temperament's comma sequence maps the 7th partial to the fundamental's augmented sixth (see Video 5). On the one hand, adding this narrows the valid tuning range of the syntonic temperament to the 7-limit range of a mere 5 cents (centered on 1/4-comma meantone, P5=696.58 cents; see Figure 1). On the other hand, it adds the 7th partial to the timbre, on a unique note, which gives musicians the option of emphasizing that partial when playing blues-inspired music. (See Primeness above. Real-time changes to the sevenness of a 7-limit timbre could prove to be musically useful.)

The augmented sixth is far to the right of the fundamental on the Wicki-Hayden keyboard (as shown in Video 5), so it is suitable for use in the I-IV-V blues progression in only C and keys flat-ward thereof.

Playing harmonic timbres in just intonation[edit source]
The ability to temper tuning and timbre together does not require such tempering, or preclude their independent control. Using a user interface such as the Tone Diamond,[17] a musician can opt to maximize regularity, harmonicity, or consonance—or trade off among them in real time, with consistent fingering. This enables the tunings of Dynamic Tonality to be regular or irregular, equal or non-equal, major-biased or minor-biased—and enables the musician to slide smoothly among these tuning options in real time, exploring the emotional affect of each tuning and the changes among them.

Compared to microtonality[edit source]
Imagine that the valid tuning range of a temperament (as defined in Dynamic Tonality) is a string, and that individual tunings are beads on that string. The microtonal community has typically focused primarily on the beads, whereas Dynamic Tonality is focused primarily on the string. Both communities care about both beads and strings; only their focus and emphasis differ.

Example: C2ShiningC[edit source]
An early example of Dynamic Tonality can be heard in "C to Shining C" C2ShiningC (composed and recorded by William Sethares in April 2008). This sound example contains only one chord, Dmaj (the piece is, oddly enough, recorded or transposed in the recording to D major, despite its name), played throughout, yet a sense of harmonic tension is imparted by a tuning progression and a timbre progression, as follows:

Cmaj 19-tet/harmonic -> Cmaj 5-tet/harmonic -> Cmaj 19-tet/consonant -> Cmaj 5-tet/consonant

The timbre progresses from a harmonic timbre (with partials following the harmonic series) to a 'pseudo-harmonic' timbre (with partials adjusted to align with the notes of the current tuning) and back again.
Twice as rapidly, the tuning progresses (via polyphonic tuning bends), within the syntonic temperament, from an initial tuning in which the tempered perfect fifth (P5) is 695 cents wide (19-tone equal temperament, 19-tet) to a second tuning in which the P5 is 720 cents wide (5-tet), and back again.
As the tuning changes, the pitches of all notes except the tonic change, and the widths of all intervals except the octave change; however, the relationships among the intervals (as defined by the syntonic temperament's period, generator, and comma sequence) remain invariant (i.e., consistent) throughout. This invariance among a temperament's interval relationships is what makes Dynamic Tonality possible.

In the syntonic temperament, the tempered major third (M3) is as wide as four tempered perfect fifths (P5's) minus two octaves—so the M3's width changes across the tuning progression

from 380 cents in 19-tet (P5 = 695), where the Cmaj triad's M3 is very close in width to its just width of 386.3 cents,
to 480 cents in 5-tet (P5 = 720), where the Cmaj triad's M3 is close in width to a slightly flat perfect fourth of 498 cents, making the Cmaj chord sound rather like a Csus4.
Thus, the tuning progression's widening of the Cmaj's M3 from a nearly-just major third in 19-tet to a slightly flat perfect fourth in 5-tet creates harmonic tension, which is relieved by the return to 19-tet.

This is an example of Dynamic Tonality's ability to expand the frontiers of tonality by offering new means of creating tension and release, even within a single chord.




I would not claim that the results of this algorithm fully describe the energy distribution of spectra, nor that they map perfectly onto the perceptual basis for timbre discrimination of steady state tones. However, they do tell us something about a phenomenon that among musicians is generally referred to as “brightness” (hence my choice of name). It is a known fact in phonetics that even single sine waves are perceived as having different tone colors according to register. As Cogan (1998) describes it: “In the lowest registers a sine tone suggests the dull grave sounds [u] (oo) or [o] (oh); [and] in the higher registers its quality resembles [a] (ah) or the bright, acute sound [i] (ee)” (12). Hence the presence of higher partials in a complex sound will invariably make it sound “brighter” or more “acute,” whereas their absence will create a “duller,” “darker” effect. Even the same exact energy spectrum distribution will change timbre when transposed in register, as playing a tape at double speed would illustrate.

От Yuri Kasparov – Все: (3:13 ПП)
Sonoristics is the basis of the Concerto musical language. Of course, sonoristics is one of the most promising trends in contemporary music.
От Yuri Kasparov – Все: (3:13 ПП)
There are many reasons for this statement. First of all, it is because the nowadays musical space has changed significantly after the composers of New Viennese school and after the composers-structuralists.
От Yuri Kasparov – Все: (3:14 ПП)
Those coordinates of the musical space that were systemically important today have lost their meaning. And those expressive means, which in the past were a kind of decor, became the coordinates of the musical space. Later I will talk about this in more detail. The second reason to claim that sonoristics is one of the most promising trends of today is that a discrete scale began to slow down composer's thought. And really, why should we work with artificially divided into separate notes sound space? It became cramped for us under the conditions of the so-called countable set, and we have long been thinking in terms of the set of continuum power sets. That is, we need a continuous sound spectrum.
От Yuri Kasparov – Все: (3:16 ПП)
But there is one serious problem: we do not know how to structure sonoristics. We are only at the beginning of this way, and we have not found those methods of how to organize the form in a sonor work. People have come a long way before reaching the classical sonata form. And now we, in fact, are starting from scratch again. For the time being, we structure sonoristics based on the principles of theater or literature. Sometimes we ourselves are not aware of this report. But fact is fact - we do not have universal principles for the organization of sonoristic material. Perhaps things will go faster if we rethink the metro-rhythmical coordinate of the musical space. If we refuse recording with bars and find an adequate replacement, this will be a big step ahead! The search for such a replacement has been ongoing since the middle of the last century, and we have accumulated interesting experience. But the problem has not yet been resolved.

The search for such a replacement has been ongoing since the middle of the last century, and we have accumulated interesting experience. But the problem has not yet been resolved.

От Yuri Kasparov – Все: (3:42 ПП)
Exposition is an eternal concept that does not depend on the tonal system, nor on the musical language, nor on the specifics of the musical space. At the exposition, the composer shows the “building material” with which he intends to “build” his musical building. And this is closely related to the concept of the musical space in which the composer is located. In the Bach’s works, for example, the musical space was limited to only two coordinates: sound pitch and metro-rhythm. Only these coordinates formed a system.
От Yuri Kasparov – Все: (3:42 ПП)
After the New Viennese school, and especially after the composers- structuralists (Boulez, Stockhausen, Nono), each composer essentially works in his own tonal system. And everyone has his own musical space. For example, for some, dynamics is a system-forming factor, while others do not. For many composers today a sound-pitch coordinate is not a system-forming factor, and this is a very important sign of the time! Its place was taken by timbre-texture - a new phenomenon that arose after the  avant-garde of the 50s – 70s of the last century.

От Yuri Kasparov – Все: (3:46 ПП)
Any exposition must have a clear dramaturgy. I will not dwell on how the exposition is organized in my Concert and I will point out only one circumstance - the descending glissando of the string cluster and the water-gong in the very end of the first episode. This is a kind of response, a reaction to an ascending organ glissando at the very beginning. And thus, a kind of framing arch is formed.

От Yuri Kasparov – Все: (3:51 ПП)
The main principle of material development in the Concerto is timbral modulation. I have already said that after composers-structuralists, each composer actually uses his own tonal system. Here is the very case when the sound pitch is not the coordinate of the musical space, and its place is taken by the timbre-texture. It follows that the principles of development should be different, not similar to the principles of classical composers and romantic composers familiar to us.
От Yuri Kasparov – Все: (3:51 ПП)
What is timbral modulation? In this concerto, this is such a sequence of timbres, when the initial timbre is followed by the second, closest to it, this second is followed by the third, closest to the second, the third, respectively, the fourth, closest to the third, etc. And so the movement is carried out. Although the timbres are very close one to another, in the end, such a timbre sequence takes us pretty far. We come to something new, and the path is absolutely logical!

От Yuri Kasparov – Все: (4:09 ПП)
It so happened historically that the genre of concerto implies, in particular, a demonstration of all the possibilities of soloist. And nowadays music should not be an exception. In addition to the fact that the oboe can play double and triple flagolets, consonant and dissonant multi-phonics, rapid passages, frullato, staccato and more, it also has a beautiful cantilena. And to refuse this expressive reception is rather silly! But how to make the cantilena sound and at the same time stylistically do not go beyond the Concerto aesthetics? And how to make it sounds modern? In order to answer this question, one must understand how modern music differs from music of previous eras.
От Yuri Kasparov – Все: (4:10 ПП)
First of all, I have to say that new methods of sound production are not a determining factor. You can use jet whistles, tongue ram and more, but the music will not be modern. First and foremost: modern music is determined by its attitude to musical time. If in the days of the classics and, in particular, the Viennese classics, musical time flowed evenly, then among the romantics this uniform movement began to loosen. Rubato began to appear, tempo changes, length, etc. Today, musical time is subject to a complex law, and the classical and romantic concepts of time are only components of today's formula.

erv wilson
Principle points of departure for his work were the generalized keyboards of Bosanquet, the theory of "evolving tonality" of the Polish-American musicologist and theorist Joseph Yasser, from which Wilson extrapolated wider varieties of new scalar types (his "scale tree"), typically identified by a total number of tones and a generating interval, and the arithmetic insights of the Mexican theorist Agusto Novaro. He collaborated with Harry Partch, Adrian Fokker, John H. Chalmers, Jr., and Lou Harrison. Wilson explored scales and tuning systems in just intonation, equal temperaments, and systems that do not easily fall into either category.  He designed a large number of instruments, principally keyboards (the 19-tone generalized Hackleman-Wilson clavichord was a notable example) and mallet percussion and experimented with novel guitar frettings and collected a large number of indigenous flutes with equally-spaced fingers holes, thus approximating subharmonic series, along the lines described by Kathleen Schlesinger.

Above and beyond the large number of practical solutions for instruments and notations typically presented in his virtuoso draughtsman's manuscript (he was employed, for many years, in the aerospace industry, as a draughtsman while also managing his ranch in Chihuahua where he carried out experiments in corn and chenepod hybrids) and the huge variety of techniques he developed for generating new scales and systems with musically useful potential (see especially the articles on the "Marwa Pemutations" and the "Purvi Modulations" as well as his later work with sequences of intervals associated with patterns in Pascal's Triangle, the "meta-meantone", "meta-slendro", "meta-pelog" and "metal-mavila", in particular,)  I believe one of his most valuable contributions was the "combination-product set" which built upon his insight that the "tonality diamond" of Partch (with a precedent in Novaro, a diamond was basically a harmonic series multiplied by its subharmonic mirror) was, at base, a selection of tones based on globally organizing the factors of the (just) intervals between them. While the diamonds tended, inevitably, to reinforce a single tonal center, the Combination-Product Sets tended instead to be locally tonal while globally centerless, rich in symmetrical intervallic structures, but also rich in the total varieties of relationships found relative to each tone, and all in a compact system of just intonation of, typically, 6, 20 or 70 tones in total. To some degree, one could find in such a rich system a compelling alternative to many contemporary atonal practices in 12-equal.


Erv Wilson is a contemporary American music theorist who is best known for his innovative approaches to tuning. While his ideas on Moments of Symmetry (MOS) are gaining currency, his exploration of a subset of scales called Secondary MOS sometimes also referred to as “sub-moments”, “nested MOS” or “bi-level MOS” is perhaps less recognised. This presentation introduces the concept of Secondary MOS as a set of interrelated scales derived from a parent MOS to form a family of variations. It also considers the significance of traditional Japanese scales in Wilson’s understanding and development of his ideas by analysing one of his documents entitled “The Tanabe Cycle and Parallelogram from the Tanabe Cycle” (1998). This article is named after the Japanese musicologist Hisao Tanabe who showed how various five-tone scales found in traditional Japanese music are derived from a seven-tone cyclical scale (c. 1947).

My presentation focuses on ways in which Wilson transforms and extends Secondary MOS through methods of transposition and rotation of pitches to create a varied but unified scheme of scales. It also identifies the “disjunction” (or leftover interval that closes the cycle) as an important signpost for determining one’s place in a scale. The discussion includes audio examples and illustrations in which Secondary MOS are mapped onto various lattice diagrams as well as Wilson’s generalized keyboard to reveal the structural properties of these scales as well as suggest numerous ways for how they might be applied to music. The paper concludes with the suggestion that Secondary MOS exemplify Wilson’s approach to tuning by which he extrapolates the inherent features of systems and transforms their patterns into general principles to provide new tools and creative resources for musicians to explore.





The rule for the generator is in the OP; the rule for the period (and this is for Stephen Weigel too) is that if any ratios lie *on* the line connecting 1/1 with the comma ratio, they represent the period and its iterations (and otherwise, the period is an octave).
If the line passes through N ratios not including 1/1 and the comma ratio, then the period (after tempering) will be 1/(N+1) octave, so all the ratios on the line get tempered to different integer multiples of 1/(N+1) octave.





Hey folks,
Paul Erlich and I were talking yesterday about the 2-D 5-limit lattice. He taught me how to draw lines on said lattice to find generators for 2-D tunings. To find a 2-D tuning's generator:
(1) Draw a line from 1/1 to the comma (and its inversion, etc.)
(2) Find another pitch closest to the line that is not on the line: that is the generator (tempered, of course, in TOP)
(2.5) An alternate method is to draw a straight line connecting pitches and extending out from 1/1 in both directions. If this is done at every pitch tempered to unison by the comma, it should hit every point on the 2-D lattice IF the straight line in question is actually the generator. Otherwise, the straight line would extend at a larger angle, skipping some pitches diagonally as it extends.

about supercollider track:
As for my code, I have to admit I lost the original (made back in 2016), but I just had a quick look at some sketches I still have. My code is often a bit messy, and now I see it I think I exaggerated a bit on 30 lines (:roll_eyes:), but there’s not so much. The blippy drum clicks are made by sending signals through either CombC, or in another case using Pulse and sending it through a RHPF filter, and really messing around by trial and error with the bandwidth. The rest is like Nathan said, using Pbinds and randomness, which always gives you some interesting sounds which you can either leave, or try to find ‘the’ right sound. By the way, the drone in my piece is very simple, it’s just a sampled gong played backwards in a loop (using BufPlay), but played at different speeds and overlapped (4x).


Apart from synth melodies (often made using SinOsc), the other sounds are piano notes played randomly backwards, forwards, different speeds, pitches and the lot. I spent an afternoon at work - I’m a music teacher - meticulously recording each note on the piano, and then cleaning them up (on audacity). The result being I now have a great file built up of all sorts of piano sounds, hits, scrapes and all - they’re up on Freesound.org. The rest of the effects in there I’ve forgotten what they were?!

JITModular it makes it easier to use JITLib NodeProxies as synth modules. It was hard (the JIT part was easy; saving/restoring, and buffer/MIDI management were hard) and I had to do some hacky things to get there, but I can now experiment with different oscillators, filters, other processors, swapping them in and out dynamically, and saving the whole thing to disk to be restored later. After that, it does take a little work to copy the pieces into a unified SynthDef, but overall it saves me time because I can test out small changes to the graph by just switching out one module. https://github.com/jamshark70/JITModular 14

p = JITModPatch.new;
… and then, in the code window, create ~module = { ... synthesis ... }. A module can have an audio input by writing JMInput.ar, and then you supply a signal to it by writing ~source <>> ~target.

For example, I just made a synth with a gapped wavetable oscillator (with layered detuning) --> HPF/LPF pair acting like a band pass filter --> Shaper adding higher harmonics --> reverb. At each stage, I could play with it to get the sound right. Then rewrite as a SynthDef, add a slow envelope, sequence it, and New Age magic:


James, that sounds great. It also reminds me that I seem to remember a very simple line of code that could be added at the end of a synthdef and which made the various args into sliders. However, I can’t remember what it was, or where I found it - either in the sc book, or maybe in an example?

Probably you mean the metadata arg, used with key ‘specs’. I meanwhile got the habit to almost always write SynthDefs with metadata specs.

With standard lib you can use ‘makeGui’ (not widely used this way it seems), with miSCellaneous installed ‘sVarGui’.

// using 'myFreq' here, as for 'freq' and 'amp' there are already global specs defined
(
SynthDef(  est, { |myFreq, amp|
  Out.ar(0, SinOsc.ar(myFreq, 0, amp))
}, metadata: (
  specs: (
    myFreq: [20, 10000, \exp, 0, 400]
  )
)
).add
)


SynthDescLib.global[\test].makeGui

\test.sVarGui.gui




For a quick example, using that system, you would p = JITModPatch.new and, in the patch code window:

// JMInput.ar is part of JITModular: Module's audio input
// .play() connects this module to the speakers
~out = { JMInput.ar }; ~out.play(vol: 0.2);

~osc = { Saw.ar(440) };  // simple oscillator

~osc <>> ~out;  // connect to output

~filter = { LPF.ar(JMInput.ar, 2000) };

// modules can be chained in series
// you can read the synth structure directly from the code
~osc <>> ~filter <>> ~out;

// add a control input
~osc = { |freq = 440| Saw.ar(freq) };

// swap in a different type of oscillator
~osc = { |freq = 440, width = 0.5| Pulse.ar(freq, width) };

// for GUI: set an appropriate range for 'width'
~osc.addSpec(\width, [0.01, 0.5]);

// swap in a different filter




But debatable if this is eligible or necessary. Personally I like to use SC in order to obtain things that are hardly or impossible with analogue devices, the digital space of possibilities feels infinite, but this alone is not an argument pro or contra per se. Luckily however worlds can be linked also.

Not being an expert with analogue devices I find them inspiring, e.g. I’ve written the smooth wavefolding classes contained in miSCellaneous quark because I stumbled across analogue wavefolding following Buchla. It’s an anti-aliasing variant of SC main lib’s Fold UGen, pictures of some options on a sine source might be self-explaining:

Can you have several outputs with JITModular ? Like a sequencer which would output triggers and notes ?
Currently, in JITModular, it assumes audio-rate proxies should be stereo, but you can pre-define the number of output channels:

~audio2 = { DC.ar(0) ! 4 };
StereoNodeProxy.nil(localhost, nil): wrapped channels from 4 to 2 channels
~audio2
-> StereoNodeProxy.audio(localhost, 2)

~audio4.ar(4);  // pre-define
~audio4 = { DC.ar(0) ! 4 };
~audio4
-> StereoNodeProxy.audio(localhost, 4)
.kr proxies are free, as many channels as you output.

But IMO the better way to sequence in JITModular is with patterns.

~player = \psSet -> Pbind(
  \skipArgs, [\list, \of, \symbols, \to, \ignore],
  \degree, ...,
  \dur, ...
);
… which will treat any gt inputs as gates and t_trig inputs as envelope triggers.






so far I’ve been outputting CV using these synths:

SynthDef (\trigger) {
  arg out = 0;
  var env = Env.step (1.asArray, SampleDur.ir.asArray);
  env = EnvGen.ar (env, doneAction: 2);
  Out.ar (out, env);
}.add;

SynthDef (\static_value) {
  arg out = 0, volts = 0, lag_time = 1, lag_on = 0;
  var sig, lag_sig;
  sig = Lag.kr (volts * 0.097, 0);
  sig = K2A.ar (sig);
  lag_sig = Lag3.ar (sig, lag_time);
  sig = SelectX.ar (lag_on, [ sig, lag_sig ]);
  Out.ar (out, sig);
}.add;

SynthDef (\ramp) {
  arg out = 0, start_value = 0, end_value = 1, time = 1, curve = 0;
  var env = Env.new ([ start_value, end_value ], time, curve);
  env = EnvGen.ar (env, doneAction: 2);
  Out.ar (out, env);
}.add;
the example I posted above used this code for sequencing:

Computer music is a highly dynamic field of activity. I'll list here a few of my favourite papers and links that didn't make it into the first edition (due to the publishing schedule or my own slow reactions), but which are really worth exploring. I'm also happy to hear from you if you feel there are things that really should be covered in a possible future edition (for example, more on sound design, audiovisuals and multimedia work, etc.).

Here are a few examples of great resource texts I read since the book went to press that I'm sorry to have left out:

Timbral listening is a technique used in both the composition and reception of Timbre-centered music which has been created using Timbre composition.
Notable composers working on this genre include Helmut Lachenmann, Panayiotis Kokoras, Iancu Dumitrescu.



For those wondering about good uses of Shepard tones. There is the Endless flanger, phaser series VST plugins by Oli Larkin which are very nice.
On this code, change the oscillator to WhiteNoise and apply the shepard patterns to the freq from a BPF with a narrow Q and you'll get endless eerie wind storms

torsor <=> Lewin's "general interval system"


William Sethares' "Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum, Scale" is the best book about this. He has a convincing demonstration that "pure ratios" are not in themselves important: what's important is that the overtones of two simultaneously-sounding notes match. Since harmonic tones have partials that are integer multiples of the fundamental, you get pure ratios.
как именно match up?
по каким формулам бы попробовать построить обертона-гармоники?




Rahn has the following comments on Lewin's book. I find them interesting because it shows music theorists grappling with ideas like category theory.

There are some problems in the formal ideas in this book, and extensions to them:
GIS: Oren Kolman has recently shown (Kolman 2003) that every GIS can be rewritten as a group, so that all group theory applies directly ("transfers") to GIS. Among other things, this points up a possible flaw in the definition of GIS; a more intuitive definition would restrict a group of intervals to some cyclic group of one generator (my assertion). (See Kolman 2003.)

Definitions in Ch 9: There is a problem here which prevents having more than one arrow-label between any two nodes. Lewin defines an arrow in his node-arrow def (p. 193) as an ordered pair of points, then maps ARROW into SGP, so each ordered pair of nodes has exactly one transformation in the semigroup that labels the arrow (one arrow). This probably originates in Lewin's work with groups of intervals, which are constrained to work this way. Of course in most groups, such as D24, you need multiple arrows. There are various alternatives which would work for networks with multiple arrow(-labels) for a given ordered pair of nodes. Multiple arrows (or labels on an arrow, depending on the definitional system) in digraphs are standard, and it is hard to see what is accomplished by not allowing more than one relationship between any two nodes in the model. You also need multiple arrows for groups applied to graphs, category theory, etc.
With this change, a Lewin network is formally a commutative diagram in some musical category - a directed graph with arrows labeled in a monoid, such that the composition of paths in the underlying category is associative and so on (definition of category and of commutative diagram.) Lewin says the labels are in a semigroup but his definition of node-arrow system makes every graph reflexive, providing the identities that augment a semigroup to a monoid. So it is possible to use category theory to explore Lewin networks, much as GIS turned out to be groups: group theory transfers into GIS theory, and category theory transfers into Lewin network theory.
I made this connection in my paper, "The Swerve and the Flow: Music's Relation to Mathematics," delivered at IRCAM in October 2003 and subsequently published in PNM 42/1; I think I was the first to say this. I expanded on this idea in a talk at the ICMC, Miami, Nov 2 2004, called "Musical Acts"; in this talk I expanded into the relation of Lewin nets to the fundamental group of a topological space, and to homotopy classes, and adding category theory as a solution to part of a set of criteria for a general music theory. Later in this seminar I'll give a talk about all this.

Pick a temperament. Let’s call the temperament you chose the Foo temperament.
Now, explore it using tuning-aligned timbres.
  What well-formed scales does Foo support, if any?
  What 2-dimensional note-layouts are isomorphic with Foo?
  What are the valid tuning ranges of these scales in Foo (at various prime limits)?
  What are the tonal resources of Foo – its
    scales,
    modes,
    cadences,
    chord progressions,
    tonnetz,
    orbifolds,
    etc.?
  Which of these are – at some useful level of abstraction – shared by other temperaments?
  Which are unique to Foo?
  Which are invariant all across Foo’s tuning continuum, and which are unique to specific tuning sub-ranges or to specific tunings?

Your goal, metaphorically speaking, is to produce an accurate (but high-level) map the New Musical World of Foo, so that the musicians and theorists who follow you can explore Foo in finer detail (perhaps through compositions that explore Foo’s structures’ “ability to reliably induce, in audiences, compositionally useful emotional responses;” see Composition, above). This task involves the scientific practices of reduction and abstraction: reducing each given structure down to its smallest components, and abstracting each such structure to the highest useful level of generalization. The process and results of this task, applied to many temperaments, should eventually reveal many new and compositionally-useful insights into music’s structure.



Polyphonic tuning bends, in which (for example) a tuning bend in the syntonic temperament from P5=696 to P5=702 (that is, from 19-edo to Pythagorean tuning) makes the sharps sharper and the flats flatter. Polyphonic tuning bends enable
  Tuning progressions, such as the one used in “C to Shining C” (Sethares, 2008);
  Tuning color, in which a tuning is used in passing to enhance the emotional impact of its intervals;
  Temperament modulations, such as a modulation from the syntonic temperament to the schismatic temperament via a “pivot tuning.”
Dynamic timbre, including
  Dynamic sonance, which systematically mis-aligns a timbre’s partials with a tuning’s notes, thereby introducing dissonance/tension into otherwise consonant/restful notes, chords, etc.
  Timbre progressions, such as a progression from harmonic to tuning-aligned and back, such as the one used in “C to Shining C” (Sethares, 2008), discussed here;
  Dynamic primeness, in which can
    Change a timbre from sounding like a closed-bore cylindrical instrument (e.g., a clarinet) to an open-bore cylindrical instrument (e.g., flute) to an open-bore conical instrument (e.g., saxophone), just by changing the amount of energy invested in the timbre’s 2nth partials (“two-ness”).
    Produce similar timbre effects by changing other prime-nesses, such as three-ness and five-ness.
    Emphasize blue notes by dynamically changing the amount of energy invested in the timbre’s 7nth partials (“seven-ness”).
  Dynamic regularity, in which the tuning of a temperament’s notes is made more regular (e.g., ¼-comma meantone), or less regular (e.g., well temperament).

Here's another perspective on Lattices: It's called Formal Concept Analysis [1].
[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_concept_analysis

Lattices, and by extension semilattices, are one of my favourite algebraic structures in the context of programming. Their applications are innumerable, from access control, to distributed systems, to constraining the information flow of privileged information.
For example, CvRDTs (a class of conflict-free replicated data types), are made up of the semilattices over a monotonic operation. If you can prove a few basic properties about your data + the merge operation over it, you can construct a CRDT. It won't necessarily be efficient, but it's a good starting point for reasoning about the problem.

I don't think it's a lattice per se, but Darcs had a notion of an "algebra of patches": http://darcs.net/Theory/GaneshPatchAlgebra. Pijul does something similar, claiming to have "a formally correct version of Darcs' theory of patches" https://pijul.org/manual/why_pijul.html

Function fields and zeta functions of varieties over finite fields[edit source]
Artin (1924) introduced global zeta functions of (quadratic) function fields and conjectured an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis for them, which has been proved by Hasse in the genus 1 case and by Weil (1948) in general. For instance, the fact that the Gauss sum, of the quadratic character of a finite field of size q (with q odd), has absolute value
q
\sqrt{q} is actually an instance of the Riemann hypothesis in the function field setting. This led Weil (1949) to conjecture a similar statement for all algebraic varieties; the resulting Weil conjectures were proved by Pierre Deligne (1974, 1980).


Selberg zeta functions[edit source]
Main article: Selberg zeta function
Selberg (1956) introduced the Selberg zeta function of a Riemann surface. These are similar to the Riemann zeta function: they have a functional equation, and an infinite product similar to the Euler product but taken over closed geodesics rather than primes. The Selberg trace formula is the analogue for these functions of the explicit formulas in prime number theory. Selberg proved that the Selberg zeta functions satisfy the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis, with the imaginary parts of their zeros related to the eigenvalues of the Laplacian operator of the Riemann surface.



Ihara zeta functions[edit source]
The Ihara zeta function of a finite graph is an analogue of the Selberg zeta function, which was first introduced by Yasutaka Ihara in the context of discrete subgroups of the two-by-two p-adic special linear group. A regular finite graph is a Ramanujan graph, a mathematical model of efficient communication networks, if and only if its Ihara zeta function satisfies the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis as was pointed out by T. Sunada.



Other zeta functions[edit source]
There are many other examples of zeta functions with analogues of the Riemann hypothesis, some of which have been proved. Goss zeta functions of function fields have a Riemann hypothesis, proved by Sheats (1998). The main conjecture of Iwasawa theory, proved by Barry Mazur and Andrew Wiles for cyclotomic fields, and Wiles for totally real fields, identifies the zeros of a p-adic L-function with the eigenvalues of an operator, so can be thought of as an analogue of the Hilbert–Pólya conjecture for p-adic L-functions (Wiles 2000).

Expanding on the methods of musical set theory, some theorists have used abstract algebra to analyze music. For example, the pitch classes in an equally tempered octave form an abelian group with 12 elements. It is possible to describe just intonation in terms of a free abelian group.[16][17]

Transformational theory is a branch of music theory developed by David Lewin. The theory allows for great generality because it emphasizes transformations between musical objects, rather than the musical objects themselves.

Theorists have also proposed musical applications of more sophisticated algebraic concepts. The theory of regular temperaments has been extensively developed with a wide range of sophisticated mathematics, for example by associating each regular temperament with a rational point on a Grassmannian.

The chromatic scale has a free and transitive action of the cyclic group
Z
/
12
Z
{\mathbb  {Z}}/12{\mathbb  {Z}}, with the action being defined via transposition of notes. So the chromatic scale can be thought of as a torsor for the group

Harmony search (Geem, Kim & Loganathan 2001)[edit source]
Harmony search is a phenomenon-mimicking metaheuristic introduced in 2001 by Zong Woo Geem, Joong Hoon Kim, and G. V. Loganathan.[11] Harmony search is inspired by the improvisation process of jazz musicians. Harmony search has been strongly criticized for being a special case of the well-established Evolution Strategies algorithm.[12]

The Harmony search (HS) is a relatively simple yet very efficient evolutionary algorithm. In HS algorithm a bunch/group of solutions is randomly generated (Called Harmony memory). A new solution is generated by using all the solutions in the Harmony memory (rather than just two as used in GA) and if this new solution is better than the Worst solution in Harmony memory, the Worst solution gets replaced by this new solution. Although HS is a relatively new meta heuristic algorithm, its effectiveness and advantages have been demonstrated in various applications like design of municipal water distribution networks,[13] structural design,[14] traffic routing,[15] load dispatch problem in electrical engineering,[16] multi objective optimization,[17] rostering problems,[18] clustering,[19] classification and feature selection[20][21] to name a few. A detailed survey on applications of HS can be found in[22] and applications of HS in data mining can be found in.[23]



Non-Pythagorean scale[edit source]

The Non-Pythagorean scale is a musical scale and tuning, based on natural logarithms,[7] conceived and developed by Schneider. The term "Non-Pythagorean" is a reference to the Pythagorean tuning approximated by the chromatic scale.

The scale was introduced in 2007 with the release of New Magnetic Wonder, the sixth studio album by The Apples in Stereo. The album featured two brief compositions using the scale. Enhanced CD versions of the album included a third composition as well as a variety of information from Schneider concerning the scale. Audio files and instructions are also on the disc, enabling the listener to prepare a MIDI keyboard to play in the Non-Pythagorean scale.

Approximate comparison of Non-Pythagorean pitches (red)About this soundPlay (help·info) to 12-tone equal tempered pitches (blue)About this soundPlay (help·info).[6] Note that, while the equal tempered pitches increase exponentially, the pitches found lower on the Non-Pythagorean scale have frequencies that are farther apart while pitches found higher on the scale are closer together.

Since 2006 Schneider, who has a BSc in mathematics, has composed using a Non-Pythagorean scale of his own invention based on logarithms, incorporated prime numbers and the sieve of Eratosthenes in both a composition for bell towers and in the score for a play by mathematician Andrew Granville and playwright Jennifer Granville that debuted at the Institute for Advanced Study on December 12, 2009, has written a plan for an electronic composition based on prime numbers lasting millions of years, and has engaged in a number of other experimental music projects taking inspiration from mathematical concepts.

Among a number of nerdy side projects, I have invented a "non-Pythagorean" musical scale based on logarithms, invented and composed for a mind-controlled synthesizer (the Teletron) using a circuit-bent Mattel MindFlex toy (download instructions here), composed a score based on prime numbers "Reverie in Prime Time Signatures" for a play by number theorist Andrew Granville (download score here), scored the Sieve of Eratosthenes (an ancient Greek method for finding prime numbers) for church bells, written a score related to primes and abstract algebra (math explained here) that lasts anywhere from months to millions of years, designed a board game based on abstract algebra Al-Jabar with Georgia Tech PhD student Cyrus Hettle (download game rules here), and recorded a geometry-themed version of a hit song from 1916 (lyrics by "Blanche Descartes") for Gathering for Gardner in honor of Richard Guy's 100th birthday. I am also engaged in a long-term study of musical properties of flowing water, with the goal of composing a piece to be played by an artificial river.

noncommutative algebra: Group algebras, C*-algebras, von Neumann algebras, central simple algebras


Stengers has written books on chaos theory with Ilya Prigogine, the Russian-Belgian physical chemist and Nobel Laureate noted for his work on dissipative structures, complex systems, and irreversibility, especially Order out of Chaos (1984) and The End of Certainty: Time, Chaos and the New Laws of Nature (1997).[9] Stengers and Prigogine often draw from the work of Gilles Deleuze, treating him as an important philosophical source to think through questions regarding irreversibility and the universe as an open system. Stengers' most recent work has turned to her proposition of Cosmopolitics, a key aspect of which Bruno Latour refers to as the "progressive composition of a common world" in which the non-human and the human are intimately entwined, and secondly, her revisiting and pragmatic modulation of the speculative philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead. Cosmopolitics won the Ludwik Fleck Prize in 2013.[10]




Calkin–Wilf tree


One of the most striking elementary results of twentieth century mathematics was Lester Ford's discovery of remarkable circles associated to fractions. They are closely related to the Stern Brocot tree, named after a nineteenth century German mathematician and French clockmaker, and also to Farey sequences. We'll see how they also connect to a highly anorexic tiling of the first quadrant into `wedges', and (briefly) also to hyperbolic geometry.

Then we'll explain how the Stern Brocot tree allows us a simpler way to solve that most important of Diophantine equations: Pell's equation. This talk will be elementary, and suitable for undergraduates.

The oldest noncommutative logic is the Lambek calculus, which gave rise to the class of logics known as categorial grammars. Since the publication of Jean-Yves Girard's linear logic there have been several new noncommutative logics proposed, namely the cyclic linear logic of David Yetter, the pomset logic of Christian Retoré, and the noncommutative logics BV and NEL.

Gentzen's sequent calculus, which is the most studied formalism of structural proof theory.
Many other proof calculi were, or might have been, seminal, but are not widely used today.

Aristotle's syllogistic calculus, presented in the Organon, readily admits formalisation. There is still some modern interest in syllogistic, carried out under the aegis of term logic.
Gottlob Frege's two-dimensional notation of the Begriffsschrift (1879) is usually regarded as introducing the modern concept of quantifier to logic.
C.S. Peirce's existential graph easily might have been seminal, had history worked out differently.
Modern research in logic teems with rival proof calculi:

Several systems have been proposed which replace the usual textual syntax with some graphical syntax. Proof nets and cirquent calculus are among such systems.
Recently, many logicians interested in structural proof theory have proposed calculi with deep inference, for instance display logic, hypersequents, the calculus of structures, and bunched implication.

Types of proof calculi used[edit source]
There are several types of proof calculi. The most popular are natural deduction, sequent calculi (i.e., Gentzen type systems), Hilbert systems, and semantic tableaux or trees. A given proof procedure will target a specific proof calculus, but can often be reformulated so as to produce proofs in other proof styles.


Analytic philosophers have put modal logic to extensive use in their exploration of so-called alethic, epistemic, doxastic, deontological, temporal and other modalities

It must have rained overnight.  epistemic
You must arrive before noon.  deontic
A triangle must have three vertices.  alethic

In the first case, we can imagine someone who, upon leaving their house in the morning, notices that the sidewalk is wet. Based on this observation, they conclude that it has rained overnight. Here, the worlds under consideration are just those which are consistent with the speaker's knowledge, in particular, their observation of the sidewalk. Thus the box means something like, 'Given what is known, it must be the case that...'. This 'knowledge-based' interpretation of the modal operators is known as epistemic modality.

The second sentence might be uttered by airport staff to inform a passenger of the time that their flight boards. In this case, the relevant worlds are those consistent with the passenger's obligations, namely, to get to their airplane punctually. The box here means, 'Given what is obligated, it must be the case that...'. This 'obligation-based' interpretation of the modal operators is known as deontic modality.

Finally, suppose that we remove all restrictions and let the modal operators range over every single possible world at once. But we've talked about the infinity of possible worlds—what could they possibly all have in common? One thing only: logical consistency. Under this so-called alethic modality, the box now means, 'It is logically necessary that...'. This interpretation may not be commonplace in daily conversation, but is useful for discussing mathematics, as in the third sentence: by definition, a triangle has three vertices, otherwise it wouldn't be a triangle!




temporal logic in model-checking and
epistemic logic in multi-agent systems

So, in regard to the latter, modalities have been defined to represent security levels and computational resources, and more generally, what they term effects and coeffects, relating to features of the context in which programs are executed beyond mere input-output pairings.


Computers scientists are also inventive technically. Where philosophers are still largely working exclusively with propositional modal logics (K, S4, S5, etc.), first-order extensions and Kripke models for semantics, computer scientists employ sub-structural logics, coalgebra, labelled transition systems, descriptive frames and bisimulations, where these topics are often given a category theoretic treatment.

When I started making animated graphical scores in the mid-1980s, I was attracted to the études (studies)
of Frédéric Chopin; more than any music I'd experimented with, they seemed to deal in "pure pattern."
I'd read Douglas Hofstadter's April, 1982 Metamagical Themas column "Pattern, Poetry, and Power
in the Music of Frédéric Chopin" in Scientific American a few years before; it opened with this figure:

Hofstadter “Pattern, Poetry, and Power in the Music of Frederic Chopin"

sound exhibit:

https://sound.stackexchange.com/questions/347/what-is-the-best-setting-for-exhibiting-sound-art
The ideal space would have non-parallel walls, a mix of absorbent and reflective surfaces and, I guess, doors between different exhibits. Plus relatively soundproof walls. It'd cost a lot more than an ordinary art gallery to build but probably a lot less than a concert hall. I daydream about setting a place like this up one day! How it would fund itself is a tricky question: sound-based works seem harder to sell than paintings and sculptures, and government funding can be erratic. Dreams are cheap though..

Using near-field monitors may help a bit with reflections.

Acoustic panels could blend in quite nicely in an art space and either go unnoticed or used to compliment. An other artist could even use the panels and bass traps as a canvas for their art. Could be interesting.

The artist could use dryer sounds as it's source material, so the room would give it the reverberation or the space for the sound to live in. If visiting the space before starting the commission is an option, it could help during the creation process.

One exhibition I visited used speakers housed in parabolic domes suspended from the ceiling. You only heard the sound when you were directly below. It was stereo too, I think. I don't remember if there were carpets to absorb sound reflected from the floor. The sound pieces sometimes associated with video, other times not.


https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-exhibit-sound-art
For Canadian artists Janet Cardiff & George Bures Miller, however, who often create subtle sound installations outdoors, manipulating sound often comes down to dealing with mother nature. For their 2012 Documenta installation, Forest (for a thousand years), they placed 18 shoebox-sized speakers among the trees and stashed 4 subwoofers amidst the woodland underbrush of Kassel’s Karlsaue Park. These disguised devices played 28 minutes of sound collage that included everything from birdsong to artillery fire, whispers to explosions, collected by the artists from all over the world.

The piece depended on the use of  a technology known as Ambisonics, developed in the 1970s, which creates a three-dimensional sound field and creates the sensation of sounds that “move” around the visitor. “We had to have speakers of exceptional quality to create the illusion of spatial movement,” Cardiff says, explaining that the subtleties of the shifts in sound could easily be lost to the surrounding ambient noise of the great outdoors.

sum tones


John McLaughlin employs the ring modulator heavily in the 1974 Mahavishnu Orchestra album Visions of the Emerald Beyond Especially on the track "On the Way Back Home to Earth". On Miles Davis' 1975 live album Agharta, guitarist Pete Cosey ran the sounds he played through a ring modulator.[31] Deep Purple's Jon Lord fed the signal from his Hammond through a Gibson Ring Modulator unit live on stage, which he described in 1989.[32][33] Founding member of Hawkwind, Dik Mik, a self-confessed non-musician, used a ring modulator as his main instrument during his time with the band (1969-1973).[34]
Ring modulation is used in the piece Ofanim (1988/1997) by Luciano Berio, and in the first section is applied to a child's voice and a clarinet: "The transformation of the child voice into a clarinet was desired. For this purpose, a pitch detector computes the instantaneous frequency {\displaystyle f_{0}(n)} of the voice. Then the child voice passes through a ring modulator, where the frequency of the carrier {\displaystyle f_{0}(n)/2}. In this case odd harmonics prevail which is similar to the sound of a clarinet in the low register."[4][failed verification]
Analogue telephone systems[edit]
An early application of the ring modulator was for combining multiple analog telephone voice channels into a single wideband signal to be carried on a single cable using frequency-division multiplexing. A ring modulator in combination with carrier wave and filter was used to assign channels to different frequencies.
Early attempts at securing analog telephone channels used ring modulators to modify the spectrum of the audio speech signals. One application is spectral inversion, typically of speech; a carrier frequency is chosen to be above the highest speech frequencies (which are low-pass filtered at, say, 3 kHz, for a carrier of perhaps 3.3 kHz), and the sum frequencies from the modulator are removed by more low-pass filtering. The remaining difference frequencies have an inverted spectrum—High frequencies become low, and vice versa.

Erv Wilson who worked with Partch has pointed out that these added tones form a constant structure of 41 tones with two variables.[8] A constant structure giving one the property of anytime a ratio appears it will be subtended by the same number of steps. In this way Partch resolved his harmonic and melodic symmetry in one of the best ways possible.[8]

- наличие октавы, второй гармоники.
- хорошее приближение для квинты

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisector_(music)
In diatonic set theory, a bisector divides the octave approximately in half (the equal tempered tritone is exactly half the octave) and may be used in place of a generator to derive collections for which structure implies multiplicity is not true such as the ascending melodic minor, harmonic minor, and octatonic scales. Well formed generated collections generators and bisectors coincide, such as the perfect fifth (circle of fifths) in the diatonic collection. The term was introduced by Jay Rahn (1977), who considers any division between one and two thirds as approximately half (major third to minor sixth or 400 to 800 cents) and who applied the term only the equally spaced collections. Clough and Johnson both adapt the term to apply to generic scale steps. Rahn also uses aliquant bisector for bisectors which may be used to generate every note in a collection, in which case the bisector and the number of notes must be coprime. Bisectors may be used to produce the diatonic, harmonic minor, and ascending melodic minor collections. (Johnson 2003, p.97, 101, 158n10-12)

что я хочу получить:
каждая нота живёт в пространстве (k * oct, m * gen)
я хочу чтоб len * gen превращалось в какой-то oct
чтоб в октаве у нас получалось конечное число нот
конечный MOS
как это выглядит для blackwood:
  gen=400
  oct=240
  10*gen, -16*oct => 0
  (k + (m // 10) * 16)*oct, ((m % 10) * gen)
  ура!
  сложно
  16 октав

как это выглядит для porcupine:
  хочу MOS в 15 нот
  gen = 162.708
  gen * 15 = 2440.62
  => 2 * oct = 2400
  и в отрицательную пересчёт нужно тоже поправить будет
  gen * (-1) => ?

  gen:
  [k*porc_g for k in range(15)]
  [0.0, 162.708, 325.416, 488.124, 650.832, 813.54, 976.248, 1138.956,
  1301.664, 1464.372, 1627.08, 1789.788, 1952.496, 2115.204, 2277.912]

  [k*porc_g % porc_o for k in range(15)]
  [0.0, 162.708, 325.416, 488.124, 650.832, 813.54, 976.248, 1138.956, # здесь первая октава
     101.664, 264.372, 427.08, 589.788, 752.496, 915.204, 1077.912]    # здесь вторая октава

  15*gen, -2*oct => 0, вместо 40.62
  вот что я хочу

  вроде тогда простая мысль:
    считаю честное приближение по гармоникам
    получаю k*oct, m*gen
    дальше пересчитываю это как (k + (m // 15) * 2)*oct, ((m % 15) * gen)
    збс!

  единственный момент:
    какая нота соответствует (-1) * gen?
    всё ок!

    decatonic 7-limit scales


интересно
    как можно было бы модулировать между шкалами


This common pentatonic scale is a constant structure: 1/1 - 9/8 - 5/4 - 3/2 - 5/3 - 2/1
This pentatonic scale is not a constant structure: 1/1 - 25/24 - 6/5 - 3/2 - 5/3 - 2/1
Another example of a familiar scale that is not CS is the 7-note diatonic scale in 12edo.


ji scales:
diatonic: 1/1 - 9/8 - 5/4 - 4/3 - 3/2 - 5/3 - 15/8 - 2/1
simplest 7-note /2 overtone scale: 1/1 - 9/8 - 5/4 - 11/8 - 3/2 - 13/8 - 7/4 - 2/1
A decatonic scale that has been used or considered by Kyle Gann and La Monte Young in 13-limit just intonation is 1/1, 12/11, 32/27, 9/7, 4/3, 132/91, 3/2, 18/11, 16/9, 176/91, and 2/1

Harmonic Relationships in the Music of Disasterpeace:
- modal jazz




compositional technique:

I'm going to elaborate a bit on the thing that I posted as a reply to
Keenan. Let's even just say that we're sticking to rank-2.

1) Pick the temperament of your choice.
2) Pick a reasonably-sized diatonic-sized MOS to use.
3) Pick a reasonably-sized chromatic-sized MOS to use.
4) Play whatever harmony you want, dynamically changing to different
modes and MODMOS's of #2 to accommodate the harmony you want.
5) (MOST IMPORTANT) Play whatever harmony you want, dynamically
changing to different modes and MODMOS's of #3 that you use to
accommodate what you want to do.

What I really like is the effect of #3 combined with #5. This is
because I really just crave the sound of there being clearly defined
regions of interval space that I know can do different musical things
(like sound like 3/2, or whatever). I don't really care if you shift
notes by comma or diesis within those regions for different chords, I
just like to know what those regions are.

For me, if I ever hear a composition that subverts the above process,
I feel disoriented, like I'm listening to a "microtonal" piece. So if
you're just playing what to my ears sound like random otonal chords
that are running amok all over the place, I still might like the
sound, but there's some layer of musical enjoyment that's lost for me.
But if you're playing in porcupine in 22-EDO, for instance, but you
take reasonable care to always emphasize some quasi-equal 15-note set
- even if you sometimes shift notes around in those regions to
accommodate the harmony you want - I can actually hear a very clear
sense of background "scale" at that point, so I'm much happier.

I don't even know if this applies to anyone other than me*, but it
definitely applies to me. My hypothesis is that it's because I'm
basically an idiot, and I need clever cognitive strategies so that my
feeble brain can actually comprehend what's going on at all. Kind of
like how I'm not actually smart enough to imagine 1,234,567 things,
but I have a decent grasp of the number 1,234,567 because its Arabic
numeral representation is easy enough to figure out. I dunno if this
would lead to some holy grail of interval "functions" or "xentonality"
or whatever, but I do think it would be nice to experiment with music
that has a clearly defined set of "notes" as a first pass, even if
they wiggle around a little bit!

Anyway, just a suggestion for the people who are inspired and
composing these days, aka not me right now.

-Mike

*This is a lie

PS: I'm specifically looking forward to experiencing what it's like to
do the above with porcupine[15], or some 15-note Fokker block. It
would be awesome to have 15 separate regions of interval space that I
all know can do these very clearly defined psychoacoustic things,
sometimes requiring some shifts in intonation. My instinctive vision
of it is that it'd be like a more enlightened way of understanding how
your auditory system works, or something.

TIBIA

>Of
>course there is a qualitative difference due to the E vs. J, with E being
>(to my ears) "active" and J being more "abiding"

Yes. If that was all there was to it, I'd prefer JI. But another important
qualitative difference to me is that in E, the same note can function as
different ratios. For example, I'll analyze the beginning TIBIA in JI, up
through the modulation:

5/4---6/5---7/6---8/7--10/9--16/15-81/80....63/32-15/8....
1/1---1/1---1/1---1/1---1/1---1/1-243/128...27/16--3/2....
15/8---9/5---7/4--12/7---5/3---8/5-243/160...45/32-45/32...
1/1---8/5---***--10/7--16/9---4/3--27/16.....9/8---3/2....

In 22-tET 12/7 and 27/16 are represented by the same pitch, as are 10/7 and
45/32, 7/4 and 16/9, 8/7 and 9/8, and even 1/1 and 63/32(63/64). The *** can
be interpreted as either 4/3 or 21/16. On your JI guitar, you're kind of
limited with regard to which ratios you can imply, though the harmonic
variety is enough to keep things interesting.

https://algorithmiccomposition.ru/article_entry_syuita_illiaka.html
Сюита Иллиака состояла из четырех частей и генерировала ноты, ритмы и т.д. посредством случайных процессов. Между тем, для первых трех частей был применен метод порождения и проверкой гипотез — Хиллер отбрасывал изначально неподходящие варианты, которые машина генерировала в буквенно–цифровой форме, и затем переводил их в ноты. Первая часть сюиты контролировалась правилами контрапункта — Кантус фирмус — основного тона, описанными австрийским композитором Иоганном Йозефом Фуксом в его работе «Ступень к Парнасу».
1. Компьютерная программа генерировала случайные целые числа из диапазона 0–15, представляющих собой ноты двух октав диатонического До. Потом, серия нот, сгенерированных случайно, была попарно объединена в соответствии с правилами:
  - мелодия не могла выходить за рамки одной октавы;
  - мелодия должна была начинаться и заканчиваться на элементе тонического трезвучия;
  - мелодические прыжки на септиму были запрещены;
  - было запрещено повторять самую высокую ноту мелодии;
  - были разрешены интервалы — унисон, октава, минорные или мажорные квинты, сексты, терции, увеличенные кварты считались диссонансными;
  - запрет на параллелизацию квинт и октав.
2. Вторая часть начиналась со случайного упорядочивания семи нот гаммы До. Генерация продолжалась до достижения выполняемости первого этапа контрапункта — ноты против ноты, когда ритм добавленного голоса не становился идентичным ритму основного голоса.
3. Третья часть включала все 12 нот одной октавы и добавленные правила для ритма и темпа. Звуковой материал варьировался от случайной хроматической музыки до додекафонных рядов .
4. В четвертой, последней части, из правил генерации были удалены все музыкальные правила контрапункта, и компьютеру было доверено выбирать подходящие ноты, руководствуясь вероятностными методами Марковских цепей первого порядка. Марковские цепи были составлены случайным образом. Случайный процесс был основан на убеждении, что в последовательности событий, выбор нового события (в данном случае, ноты), тесно связан с непосредственно предшествующем событием.

Pitch: Stochastic processes
  Wundt curve, cognition and music generation: Brown, A., Gifford, T. and Davidson, R. (2015). Techniques for Generative Melodies Inspired by Music Cognition. Computer Music Journal, 39(1): 11-26.

Proximity: (Random Walks)
  Some of the better-known Gestalt principles are those related to grouping. One of these is the law of proximity, which states, “objects or stimuli that are viewed as being close together will tend to be perceived as a unit” (Corsini 1999). Although typically discussed in terms of visual perception, the law of proximity in its original formulation was proposed to apply to both visual and auditory perception (Wertheimer 1938). Numerous psychological studies have established proximity as a general grouping principle in music, via proximity in time (Deutsch 1999a), proximity in pitch (Bregman 1990), or proximity or similarity along more abstract musical dimensions (Deliege 1987).


Range Constraint
  Alternatively, in the spirit of research by von Hippel and others we propose a range constraint technique that operates by adding a tendency toward the mean of the range. Rather than use of the previous pitch as the point of departure for the next step in the random walk, a mean value is selected between the previous step and the middle of the range. This technique creates a kind of “elastic band” force that increases with the distance away from the mean.




composing melodies
  Patterns are key. If you write a melody in a theory exam they will give you an extract from which you can repeat certain patterns.
  After a cadence you need a rhythmical sequence. That is rhythm that is repeated for at least two bars. This a just a repeat of the rhythm the notes need not be identical.
  Know your cadences.
  Try to end on the tonic
  If you use a pause in the middle of a melody to indicate a cadence try to use cadences that do not end on the tonic. It is poor to give the feeling of ending in the middle of a melody.
  Jump only to notes in the chords. Do not jump two notes in a row. When you jump up as a general rule go down after a jump up. Go up after a jump down
  Try to use melodic minor shape if you go up from the sixth to the seven steps (In minor keys) If you go down from that remember what needs to be lowered
  Leading Tones ALWAYS needs to resolve.
  In the passage you are given take note of the form of the notes. That means if the notes go up and down in a wave form mimic it. If the notes seems more like runs mimic the runs.
  It is also critical that you know your basic chord progressions. They will help you determine which chords you will use.
  Remember your articulation.

  Have a creative constraint in place
    Many of my compositions and melodies have stemmed from trying to do a certain theoretical idea. Studying the theory behind modulation, a neapolitan 6th, the tristan chord, or the diminished 7th has led me to write the main goal of the part, and then everything else is just filler around it. once you have 4 notes and a rhythm, the rest is potentially just about what fits with them.

  Choosing Chords

  Got melody, want chords
    Figure out the key in which your melody is in.
    Figure out the triad chords can you play in that key (for example Cmaj/Amin key: Cmaj, Dmin, Emin, Fmaj, Gmaj, Bdim).
    Carefully check your melody and use the chord based on the dominant notes, usually this is simply the note which is played on the beat. So, if my key is C and the melody has a note D when the beat comes, I play Dmin, but also note that most of the time more than one chord sounds good in a particular situation.
    Don't stop when you got the chords, give them a twist (another note, different rhythm, a few notes connecting chords), using simple triads won't sound very innovative.
  Got chords, want melody
    Figure out your key, this is essentially matching the notes in your chords to a key in which those notes are possible.
    Now you know the key and the notes you can play in that key.
    Try to move in this key, first follow the chords.
    Deviate from the chords and try to make it sound good. Unfortunately, there really is no recipe for writing melodies.

  David Temperley, The Melodic-Harmonic Divorce in Rock http://davidtemperley.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/temperley-pm07.pdf
  The gist of the paper is rock music has two melodic modes: one where the melody tones agree with the harmony in a traditional way, and a second where the melody moves independently of the chords. It will take you several steps beyond a typical 'how to write a pop song' method of matching melody to chord tones with some embellishing non-chord tones.

  Trace theory provides a means for discussing multiprocessing in more formal terms, such as via the trace monoid and the history monoid. Rewriting can be performed in trace systems as well.

  Rewriting systems can be seen as programs that infer end-effects from a list of cause-effect relationships. In this way, rewriting systems can be considered to be automated causality provers.

"anti-JI" intervals
leading tone
V chord
the 3/2 the new 1/1
metastable interval generated from 5/4 and 4/3
noble mediant is ~422.5 cents
4/3 (e.g. the true tonic)
leading tone is ~75.6 cents
The geometric approximations we've been talking about give similar results at ~80.for X = phi/sqrt(5)
If we have some particular leading tone in mind, we could also use that to choose the right value of X to begin with. Something near X = 0.67 seems to be pretty decent, kind of halfway between 1/phi and phi/sqrt(5).
noble number
quotient of 4/3 and the above noble number, equal to (12+16*phi)/(12+15*phi)
non-noble feudal number being musically relevant
the most relevant anti-JI interval there is
The continued fraction expansion of this interval is [1;22,(2,2,2,26)...] where the (2,2,2,26) is repeating, with minimal polynomial 99x^2 - 180x + 80.

"noble leading tones"
For instance, suppose we are in C major. Then if we're doing a "ti->do" leading tone on the V chord of G, then the above would suggest tuning the B somewhat sharp to enhance the resolution, giving that 75.6 cent leading tone.
But enhancing the resolution from B->C may be useful even for a different choice of tonic. If we change the tonic to, let's say A instead, then the two notes B and C form ~9/8 and ~16/15 with the tonic, and if we do the same noble mediant analysis we get a leading tone of ~80 cents. Similarly, if we change the tonic to E (and in this situation the C->B resolution may be important instead), we get 3/2 and 8/5, giving a leading tone of ~90 cents. (These wouldn't technically be called leading tones in classical music, but you get the gist.)
This could be a bug or a feature, depending on how you look at it. It could perhaps make sense that, given two notes which differ by some kind of "half step," a change in tonic changes the idealized intonation for what that half step ought to be. It also highlights how noble numbers can be a bit unintuitive.
But anyway, for better or worse, the geometric approximation is much simpler. We get the same leading tone of ~80.8 cents for any pair of ratios differing by 16/15. This can be viewed as kind of a weighted average of the above, and I wouldn't be surprised if there were some way to derive this formally as such. And again, we can choose X to dial in the leading tone as we see fit.
One interesting thing, though, is that if we are in a totally different subgroup, like 2.3.7, playing in something like semaphore temperament where the ratios we are emphasizing are all totally different, both of these models will give us a different idealized leading tone.

Lastly, a thought about temperaments.
Whatever you think the correct leading tone is, let's call it "L" and assume it is something in the ballpark of this ~75 cent interval. So we can look at the 2.3.5.L subgroup.
We usually talk about extensions of, for instance, 2.3.5 meantone to the 2.3.5.7 subgroup. We can also talk about extensions of it to this 2.3.5.L subgroup instead. There are immediately a few very important extensions.
The first is the one that says that L = 16/15. This is basically the way that meantone has been used for hundreds of years; it should be the standard meantone extension on this subgroup. So B->C is the leading tone. It isn't the best in terms of accuracy of L, but it's very low in complexity; there are two leading tones in the diatonic scale. It works well enough, and even serves as a data point that L shouldn't have a very high weighting, in that L is alright even if it's some ~30 cents off (at least if tuned wide; the tolerance seems to be asymmetric). This is supported by the <7 11 16 1| val, which means that leading tones change the diatonic scale degree by one.
The second is the one that says L = 25/24. Cb -> C is the leading tone. I've seen this suggested quite a bit in the past 15 years. The accuracy is much better, but things are higher in complexity. You will probably tend to think that this mapping is better if you're playing in minor rather than major. This temperament is supported by the <7 11 16 0| val, meaning the leading tone is just chromatically altering the same scale degree. This can be kind of weird, and for the purpose of playing melodies you are probably best just pretending that somehow it is supported by <7 11 16 1|, meaning you treat Cb as "another kind of B" in melodies even though it technically isn't.
There are a few others of interest. One of them says that the leading tone is equal to 128/125, which is useful in 19-EDO. So B#->C is the leading tone. This is also supported by <7 11 16 1|.
Another one, which is a weak extension, has L = 16/15 * sqrt(24/25). This says that the leading tone is equal to B‡ -> C. 31-EDO supports this. Basically, you strengthen the leading tone by half-sharping the major 7th. Again supported by <7 11 16 1|.
There are others but I think those are mainly the ones of musical interest.
If we are using feudal numbers to model this, then L = (12+16*phi)/(12+15*phi), so 2.3.5.L is just a different basis for 2.3.5.n4/3. This is itself a subgroup of 2.3.f5.f11, generated by feudal primes, although there is no real need to introduce sqrt(5) if we only care about the n4/3 noble and the interval it makes with 4/3. If we are going with the geometric approximation, then L = (16/15)^X, where X is somewhere around 0.7. This is also a subgroup of 2.2^X.3.3^X.5.5^X, although again there is no need to introduce the other primes.
