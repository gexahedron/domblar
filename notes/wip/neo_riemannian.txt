        very nice

Теории тональности:
    - (ренессанс)
    - functional harmony
        diatonic, circle of fifths, cadence
        voice-leading
        dominant, subdominant
        augmented sixth, neapolitan
    - counterpoint
    - modes
    - jazz chords extensions, voicings
    - NRT
        Tonnetz,
        octatonic, hexatonic, RPL (SLIDE), chromatic mediants
    - Scale networks
        diatonic, octatonic, hexatonic,
        acoustic, harm maj, harm min, whole-tone
        voice-leading
    - Zabka
        + hungarian minor
    - Tonfeld + Rohrmeier
        Tonnetz,
        octatonic, hexatonic, stack of fifths,
        hierarchical tree
    - Tone Clock theory
        ...
    - spectralism
        harmonics
        ...



3 цикла:
    PLPLPL - на самом деле это hexatonic scale
    PRPRPRPR - на самом деле это octatonic scale
    PLRPLR - вот здесь нет scale; здесь типа во всех аккордах есть общая нота

    L = Leichtonwechsel (root change = M3 up (for maj) or down (for min), mode change)
    P = Parallel (no root change, mode change)
    R = Relative (root change = m3 down (for maj) or up (for min), mode change)
    S = SLIDE (root change = m2 up (for maj) or down (for min), mode change)
    M = chromatic mediant (root change = major third down, no mode change)
    M-1 = chromatic mediant inverse (root change = major third up, no mode change)
    m = chromatic mediant (root change = minor third down, no mode change)
    m-1 = chromatic mediant (root change = minor third up, no mode change)
    D = dominant (root change = perfect fifth down, no mode change)
    D-1 = dominant (root change = perfect fifth, no mode change)
    N = ‘near’ fifth (root change = P4 up (if maj) or down (if min), mode change)
    F = ‘far’ fifth (root change = P5 up (if maj) or down (if min), mode change)
    H = ‘Hexatonic Pole’ (root change = M3 down (if maj) or up (if min), mode change)
    T6 = Tritone transposition (root change = tritone, no mode change)

    Frank Lehman gives these in Hollywood Harmony:
    Abbr.	Full
    Tn	Transpose by n
    P	Parallel
    L	Leading-tone exchange (Leittonwechsel)
    R	Relative
    S	Slide
    N	Near fifth (Nebenverwandt—"neighbor-related")
    F	Far fifth (I prefer M for Modalverwandt)
    H	Hexatonic pole
    D	Dominant
    I	Identity or “E” (short for the German “Einheit”)
    I would add O for the octatonic pole.


Kyle Gann:
    My microtonal music uses a process of micro-interval voice-leading that Harry Partch called “Tonality Flux,” related to Neo-Riemannian transformations, but of course not reducible to them

  There have been a few papers that talk about "uncanniness" in relationship to neo-Riemannian transformations (or, more specifically, tritone progressions, tarnhelms and other compound transformations).
    David Forest - PL Voice Leading and the Uncanny in Pop Music
    Scott Murphy - The Major Tritone Progression in Recent Hollywood Science Fiction Films
    Frank Lehman - Transformational Analysis and the Representation of Genius in Film Music
    Adam Ricci - A 'Hard Habit to Break': The Integration of Harmonic Cycles and Voice-Leading Structure in Two Songs by Chicago
  And these are good, from a methodological perspective:
    Richard Cohn - Square Dances with Cubes
    Richard Cohn - Neo-Riemannian Operations, Parsimonious Trichords, and Their "Tonnetz" Representations
    Jack Douthett and Peter Steinbach - Parsimonious Graphs: A Study In Parsimony, Contextual Transformations, and Modes of Limited Transposition
    Vaibhav Mohanty - Dodecatonic Cycles and Parsimonious Voice-Leading in the Mystic-Wozzeck Genus

    Joon Park - Some Reflections on (and in) Strunk's Tonnetz
