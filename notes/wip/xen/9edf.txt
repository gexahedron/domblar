        9edo contains a pentatonic mos scale produced by stacking 4/9 of 2L 3s (1 3 1 3 1) – with a heptatonic extension – 2L 5s (1 1 2 1 1 2 1, sometimes called "mavila" or "antidiatonic"). Indonesian pelog scales sometimes use five-tone subsets of a seven-tone superset in a similar way, and it has been suggested that Indonesian gamelan music stems from a 9edo tradition. You can also use the 2/9, which generates mos scales of 1L 3s (3 2 2 2) and 4L 1s (2 2 2 2 1) and can be interpreted as either an extremely sharp bug scale or an extremely flat orwell one.
